# Workshop 01 - Direct Marketing with Amazon SageMaker using Jupyter Notebook

In this workshop, you will learn how to use Amazon SageMaker to build, train and deploy a machine learning (ML) model, using Amazon Sagemaker SDK.  This workshop will use the SageMaker built-in algorithm XGBoost.  


## Prerequisite for Workshop 01

* On the left panel of SageMaker Studio, please click on icon `File Browser` and double click Jupyter notebook [xgboost_direct_marketing_sagemaker.ipynb](./xgboost_direct_marketing_sagemaker.ipynb) under folder `mlu-workshop/2.build_train_deployment/` to open the notebook.
* Follow the steps to learn build/train/deploy model on Amazon SageMaker platform.

## Conclusion
In this workshop we have walked through the process of building, training, tuning and deploying an XGBoost Model using SageMaker built-in algorithms. We have also looked at the console view while we performed the training, automated model tuning and hosting the model.

## Next
In the next workshop [Using SageMaker Autopilot](./../autopilot/README.md), you will learn how to automate the machine learning pipeline process.
