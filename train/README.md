# Workshop 01 - Direct Marketing with Amazon SageMaker using Jupyter Notebook

In this workshop, you will learn how to use Amazon SageMaker to build, train and deploy a machine learning (ML) model, using Amazon Sagemaker SDK.  This workshop will use the SageMaker built-in algorithm XGBoost.  


## Prerequisite for Workshop 01

  1. Click on this `mlu-workshop` folder and then on the `train` sub-folder and then double click on the file: `xgboost_direct_marketing_sagemaker.ipynb` to load a Jupyter notebook.
  2. If you are prompted to choose a Kernel, choose the “Python 3 (Data Science)” kernel and click “Select”.

  4. You have now successfully opened the Juypter notebook for <b>workshop 1</b>. The rest of the workshop 1 can be completed, by following the steps outlined in the notebook.


## Conclusion
In this workshop we have walked through the process of building, training, tuning and deploying an XGBoost Model using SageMaker built-in algorithms. We have also looked at the console view while we performed the training, automated model tuning and hosting the model.


## Next
In the next workshop [Using SageMaker Autopilot](./../autopilot/README.md), you will learn how to automate the machine learning pipeline process.
