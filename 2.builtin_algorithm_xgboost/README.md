# Lab 02 - Direct Marketing with Amazon SageMaker SDK using Jupyter Notebook

In this lab, you will learn how to manually build, train and deploy a machine learning (ML) model, using Amazon Sagemaker SDK.  This model will use the SageMaker built-in algorithm XGBoost.  


## Prerequisites

* On the left panel of SageMaker Studio, please click on icon `File Browser` and double click Jupyter notebook [xgboost_direct_marketing_sagemaker.ipynb](./xgboost_direct_marketing_sagemaker.ipynb) under folder `amazon-sagemaker-mlu-workshop-2022/2.builtin_algorithm_xgboost/` to open the notebook.
* Follow the steps outlined in the notebook to build/train/deploy model on Amazon SageMaker platform.

## Conclusion
In this lab we have walked through the process of manually building, training, tuning and deploying an XGBoost Model using SageMaker built-in algorithms. We have also looked at the console view while we performed the training, automated model tuning and hosting the model.
